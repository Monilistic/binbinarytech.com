<p>Software development is the process of designing, programming, documenting and mainting applications. Software development involves writing and maintaning the source code, it includes research, new development, prototyping or any other activities that result in software products</p>

<p>A software plays a key role of a mediator between the user and the computer hardware. In the absence of software, a user can't perform any task on a computer. A <b>software product development company</b> is the one which develops software for the users. </p>

<p>There are basically two main  classification of software, which are namely, <b> 1. System Software and 2. Application Software.</b> </p>


<p>System Software helps the user as well as the hardware to function and even interact with each other easily. In order word, System Software is essentially an intermediator between the user as well as the hardware. </p>
